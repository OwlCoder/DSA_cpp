# Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++
(work in progress, stay tuned)
## Algorithms:

### Sorting:

quick sort: a divide and conquer algorithm. The worst case O(n2) occurs if pivot is always greatest/lowest.
            Average case: O(nlogn)
            in place sorting and cache friendly and therefore better than merge sort
            unstable by nature but can be modified to be stable

merge sort: a divide and conquer algorithm. 

insertion sort

heap sort


### Searching:

Binary search

Interpolation search

### Greedy algorithms:
Kruskal minimum spanning tree

Prim's 

Dijkstra


## Data Structures:

Linked lists

Singly linked lists

doubly linked lists
