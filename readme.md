# C++ Library for Data Structures and Algorithms
(work in progress, stay tuned)
Uses STL wherever required/efficient
## Vectors

### Sorting:

quick sort: a divide and conquer algorithm. The worst case O(n2) occurs if pivot is always greatest/lowest.
            Average case: O(nlogn)
            in place sorting and cache friendly and therefore better than merge sort
            unstable by nature but can be modified to be stable
            better for arrays

merge sort: a divide and conquer algorithm. Stable Sorting algorithm. 
            better for linked lists

//insertion sort

//heap sort


### Searching:

Binary search

(use data structures like map (Hash tables) to do searching)

(if possible, make a graph and use a graph search algorithm )

## Graphs

### Minimum tree:
Kruskal minimum spanning tree

Prim's 

### Graph Search:
BFS

DFS

Dijkstra

A*

## Strings

### Compression Algorithm:
Huffman Coding

## Linked Lists

Singly linked lists

//doubly linked lists

### Sort:
Merge Sort

### Search

## Priority Queue

## Heaps
